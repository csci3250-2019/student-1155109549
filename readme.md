# Testing

# Hi こんにちは 你好

I am **SZETO Win Key**, Year 2 student studying *Computer Science* in CUHK

What I know about this territory is so limited, the programming language I only know was

* C (from ENGG1110 Problem Solving By Programming)
* Java (from CSCI1130 Introduction to Computing Using Java)

Both getting a pretty good grade, but yet I feel like I am still far away from being a programmer.

So back to the main topic. 

### Why am I here?

Well, isn't it obvious to finish my project.

First, let's add a table here.

Here's a JK Flip-Flop I learned in *ENGG2020 Digital Logic and System* (more like search back the lecture notes from last semester since I forgot everything from this course)

Q(n) | Q(n+1) | J | K
---- | ------ | - | -
0 | 0 | 0 | x
0 | 1 | 1 | x
1 | 0 | x | 1
1 | 1 | x | 0

Next, check what more mentioned by [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/csci3250-2019/teams/students) I need to add in this readme.md 

- [x] Header
- [x] Emphasis
- [x] List 
- [x] Task List
- [x] Table

Oh seems like I did everything already. So that's the end of my repo.

# Bye さよなら 再見
