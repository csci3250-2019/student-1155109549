# Testing

# Hi こんにちは 你好

I am **SZETO Win Key**, Year 2 student studying *Computer Science* in CUHK

What I know about this territory is so limited, the programming language I only know was

* C (from ENGG1110 Problem Solving By Programming)
* Java (from CSCI1130 Introduction to Computing Using Java)

Both getting a pretty good grade, but yet I feel like I am still far away from being a programmer.

So back to the main topic. 

### Why am I here?

Well, isn't it obvious to finish my project.

by including **task list** like this

- [ ] I am not clicking this since I don't like the first one
- [x] But click this sicne leave everything empty feels weird
- [ ] And add this empty at last to make it looks symmetry

What's left is the table only, but I cannot think of what to include in, so......

Here's a JK Flip-Flop

Q(n) | Q(n+1) | J | K
---- | ------ | - | -
0 | 0 | 0 | x
0 | 1 | 1 | x
1 | 0 | x | 1
1 | 1 | x | 0
